Talc is used in many industries, including paper making, plastics, paints and coatings, rubber, food, electric cables, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and ceramics. A coarse, grayish-green high-talc rock known as soapstone or steatite is used for stoves, sinks, and electrical switchboards. Its resistance to heat, electricity, and acids makes it suitable for the surfaces of laboratory tabletops and electrical switchboards.In it’s finely ground form, talc is used as a cosmetic, lubricant, and filler in paper manufacture. It is also used to coat the insides of inner tubes and rubber gloves during manufacture to prevent the surfaces from sticking together. At Kamlesh Minerals, we source talc from the finest mines, ensuring purity and consistency in every batch for the desired application. We pride ourselves on delivering the highest-quality talc products on the market, with a wide range of talc products to suit your application needs.",
